* use plt.gcf() and gca, to get the current figure and axes respectively

Draw a circle:
To draw a circle, you can add the Circle patch to the current Axes object:
>>>>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>>>
>>>>axes = plt.gca()
>>>>axes.add_patch(plt.Circle((0, 0), radius=1))
>>>>plt.axis('scaled')
>>>>axes.set_aspect('equal')
>>>>plt.show()

*The set_aspect() function is used to set the aspect ratio of the graph; 
 using the equal argument,
 we ask matplotlib to set the ratio of the length of the x- and y-axes to 1:1.

*you can do the same for any other matplotlib patches

*you can draw fractals by applying a rule transformation functions.
 see fern_fractal.py program as example.
