# 2: Graphical Equation Solver

This program asks the user for two expressions, both involving the dependent variable 'y', and graphs them. It also calculates and prints the solutionâ€”the pair of x and y values that satisfy both equations.

Usage:
1. Enter the first expression, using 'y' as the dependent variable.
2. Enter the second expression, using 'y' as the dependent variable.

The program will display the graphs of both expressions along with the solution, showing the point where they intersect.
