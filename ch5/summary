* The cardinality of a set is the number of members in the set.

* to generate a FiniteSet from a list or tuple, use * operator as follows:
>>> FiniteSet(*(1, 2, 3))
     {1, 2, 3}
     
*Sets in Python (like mathematical sets) ignore any repeats of a member,
 and they donâ€™t keep track of the order of set members.

*Subsets, Supersets, and Power Sets:
 s.is_subset(otherSet)
 s.is_superset(otherSet)
 >>> s = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)
 >>> s
 {{1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, {2}, {2, 3}, {3}, EmptySet()}
 
 len(s.powerset) == 2^len(set)
 
 >>> s = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)
 >>> t = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)
 >>> s.is_proper_subset(t)
 False
 >>> t.is_proper_superset(s)
 False
 >>> t = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3, 4)
 >>> s.is_proper_subset(t)
 True
 >>> t.is_proper_superset(s)
 True
 
 *Cartesian Product:
  is the set of all n-ordered pairs formed from n sets.
  
  

Probability:
*definitions:
 *experiment: the experiment is simply the test we want to perform.
 ex:Rolling a die.
 A single run of an experiment is referred to as a trial.
 
 *Sample space: all possible outcomes of an experiment form a set known as the sample space.
 ex: when a six-sided die is rolled once, the sample space is
 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
 
 *Event: an event is a set of outcomes that we want to calculate the probability of and
  that form a subset of the sample space. 
  ex: we might want to know the probability of a particular outcome, like rolling a 3.
  
  *uniform distribution each outcome in the sample space is equally likely to occur
  
  *random.randInt == a uniform_random_agent
  
  *for non uniform random selection, you should implement your own
