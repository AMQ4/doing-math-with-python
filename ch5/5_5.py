#5: Estimating the Area of a Circle

1- write a program that will find the estimated
   area of a circle, given any radius, using this approach. The program should
   print the estimated area of the circle for three different values of the num-
   ber of darts: 1e3, 1e5, and 1e6.

2- write a program that will estimate the value of Ï€ assuming any 
   value for the radius.
