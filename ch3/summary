Measuring the Dispersion
Finding the Mean:
Mean(x) = sum(x) / len(x), where x is a normal list

Finding the Median:
Median(x) = x[len(x) // 2] if the length of x is odd, o.w Mean([x[len(x)], x[len(x) - 1]]), where x is a sorted list

Finding the Mode:

* using collection module, we can find the most occurring item in a given list.
  use collection.Counter(x) class, to mnake a counter for items in x, then use most_common() method, which returns a list
  ordered by the most common elements. Each member of the list is a tuple. The first element of the first tuple is the
  number that occurs most frequently, and the second element is the
  number of times it occurs.
  
  * you can also provide an argument telling it the number of most common elements you want it to return.
  

Measuring the Dispersion:
which tells us how far away the numbers in a set of data are from the mean of the data set.

Finding the Range of a Set of Numbers:
r = max(x) - min(x)

The range tells us the difference between the two extremes in a set of numbers, but what
if we want to know more about how all of the individual numbers vary from the mean?

Finding the Variance and Standard Deviation:

first need to find the difference of each of the numbers from the mean. 
The variance is the average of the squares of those differences.

V = sum((xi - xmean)^2) / n

A high variance means that values are far from the mean; a low variance
means that the values are clustered close to the mean.

Sd = sqrt(V)

Values that are within one standard deviation of the mean can be thought of as fairly typical, whereas values
that are three or more standard deviations away from the mean can be considered much more atypical—we call such values outliers.

Why do we have these two measures of dispersion—variance and standard deviation?

Variance: Variance is advantageous when performing certain mathematical calculations or statistical
procedures that require squared values. It's used extensively in statistics to understand the 
variability in a dataset and to make inferences about the population. However, due to its square unit, 
it's not as straightforward to interpret in real-world units.


Standard Deviation: Standard deviation is more interpretable because it's expressed in the same units 
as the data. It's a go-to measure when you want to communicate the spread of data to a non-technical 
audience or when you need to understand the variability in the context of the original data.


Calculating the Correlation Between Two Data Sets:

The coefficient can be either positive or negative, and its magnitude can range between −1 and 1 (inclusive).

A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates that there’s no linear correlation between the two quantities. 
(Note that this doesn’t mean the two quantities are independent of each other. There could still be a nonlinear 
relationship between them, for example). A coefficient of 1 or close to 1 indicates that
there’s a strong positive linear correlation; a coefficient of exactly 1 is referred to as perfect positive correlation. 
Similarly, a correlation coefficient of –1 or close to –1 indicates a strong negative correlation, 
where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.

“correlation doesn’t imply causation.” e.g.correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates.

correlation(x, y) = n * sum(xi * yi) * sum(x) * sum(y) / sqrt((sum(xi^2) - sum(x)^2) (sum(yi^2) - sum(y)^2))

If the correlation were closer to 1, we’d see this reflected in the scatter plot as well—the points would 
conform more closely to a straight, diagonal line.

>>>plt.scatter(x, y) # to create a scatter plot
>>>plt.show()
