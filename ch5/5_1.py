#1: Using Venn Diagrams to Visualize Relationships Between Sets

For your challenge, imagine youâ€™ve created an online questionnaire
asking your classmates the following question: Do you play football, another
sport, or no sports? Once you have the results, create a CSV file, sports.csv.

Write a program to create a Venn diagram to depict the summarized results
of the survey.
